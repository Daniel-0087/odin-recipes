<h1>beans</h1>
<p>Beans are a nutritious legume rich in protein, fiber, and essential vitamins.</p>
<p>, making them a versatile and filling meal enjoyed across many cultures.</p>
<h1>ingredients </h1>
<ul>
    <li>perboiled rice</li>
     <li> fresh tomatoes </li>
      <li>red pepper</li>
       <li>oninons</li>
        <li> vegetable or palm oil </li>
         <li> galic and ginger </li>
          <li> seasoning cubes </li>
           <li>curry powder and thyme </li>
            <li> bay leaves</li>
             <li> salt </li>
              <li> chicken or beef </li>
               
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Prep & blend: Rough-chop tomatoes, peppers, half the onion, garlic/ginger and blend to a smooth paste.</li>
<li>Parboil (optional): Rinse rice until water runs clear. Parboil 5-6 minutes, drain — or skip and cook rice directly in sauce if you prefer.</li>
<li>Make the base: Heat oil in a large pot. Fry the remaining sliced onion until soft. Add tomato paste and fry 2 minutes to reduce raw taste.</li>
<li>Cook the blended mix: Pour in the blended tomato-pepper mix. Simmer 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reduces and the oil separates from the sauce.</li>
<li>Season: Add thyme, curry, bay leaves, seasoning cube, salt & pepper. Taste and adjust.</li>
<li>Add rice + stock: Stir in rice (parboiled or raw) then add hot stock so liquid level is about 1-1.5 cm above rice. Stir once to combine</li>
<li>Simmer covered: Reduce heat to low, cover pot (use foil under lid for tighter seal if you want). Cook 20-30 minutes until rice is done and liquid absorbed. Check after 15 min to avoid burning.</li>
<li>Final steam & fluff: Turn off heat, leave covered 5-10 minutes (steam). Then fluff with a fork. Stir in mixed veggies or pre-cooked protein if using.</li>
<li>Optional smoky finish: For extra “smoky” jollof, briefly place a piece of foil-wrapped hot coal in the pot, pour a little oil on it, close lid for 1-2 minutes, then remove (take care!).</li>
<li>Serve: Plate with fried plantains, salad or grilled chicken.</li>
